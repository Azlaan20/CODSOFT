## Machine Learning Tasks

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
In this task, I created a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. I utilized techniques like TF-IDF and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

[Task 1 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/Movie%20Genre%20Classification)

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
For this task, I built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction information. I experimented with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

[Task 2 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud)

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
In Task 3, I developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. I used historical customer data, including usage behaviour and demographics, and experimented with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

[Task 3 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)

### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
Task 4 involved building an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. I employed techniques like TF-IDF and classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.

[Task 4 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/SMS%20Spam%20Detection)

## Artificial Intelligence Tasks

### Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
In this AI task, I created a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. I used if-else statements and pattern-matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.

[Task 1 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/Response-Based%20Chatbot)

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Task 2 involved implementing an AI agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. I used algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.

[Task 2 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/Tic%20Tac%20Toe%20Game)

### Task 3: Recommendation System
In Task 4, I created a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. I employed techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

[Task 3 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/Movie%20Recommendation%20System)

### Task 4: Face Detection and Recognition
For Task 5, I developed an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. I used pre-trained face detection models and optionally added face recognition capabilities.

[Task 4 Details and Code](https://github.com/Azlaan20/CODSOFT/tree/main/Face%20Detection%20and%20Recognition)
